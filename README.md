# Challenges 
- everything in the design it was okey till the footer , because the footer system it was so complicated the web design version and the phone design version it was not the same , you will tell me yes of course it shouldn't be the same , well  is not about that 

- some elements in phone design version was seperated and between them elements , and in the web design version it was good , and however if you use flex-row or flex-coloumn it will not be fixed 

- so , because it's react & next js everything it can be easy , so i decided to use states or (useState) if the width in this page more than 500px return this component here , if not return this component in another place
